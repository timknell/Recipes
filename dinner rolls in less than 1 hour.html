These come together quickly and easily. Fluffy and not overly yeasty. With this amount of sugar, these rolls are sweeter than sandwich bread, but not as sweet as Hawaiian rolls. I modified the recipe from spendwithpennies.com to include whole wheat flour. </pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>1 cup warm tap water</li><li>1/3 cup oil</li><li>1/4 cup sugar</li><li>2 tablespoons yeast</li><li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li><li>1 egg (beaten)</li><li>1 tablespoon softened butter</li><li>3 to 4 cups bread flour (or half bread flour, half whole wheat flour)</li><li>2 tablespoons wheat gluten ((if using whole wheat flour))</li><li>1/8 cup milk room temperature</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup water, oil, sugar, and yeast. Let sit until yeast is bubbly (about 8 minutes). Stir in beaten egg softened butter and salt.

2. With a stand mixer or by hand, add flour, one cup at a time until you have a soft dough that isnâ€™t sticky. Knead by hand 10 minutes or 5 minutes with a stand mixer.

3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F

4. Divide dough into 18 even pieces, and form into balls. Place in a greased pan and cover with parchment paper and a kitchen towel.

5. Let rise 10 minutes in a warm place. (You can allow them to rise up to an additional 30 minutes if time allows).

6. Lightly brush with milk and bake on the middle rack for 10-12 minutes or just until browned.
