The traditional comfort food is great for serving large groups. In our tuna casserole recipe, we cut the sauce with chicken broth, but there's enough milk to make this casserole feel indulgent.

 </pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>3/4 pound tubetti or elbow macaroni</li><li>1 cup panko</li><li>1/2 ounce Parmesan (grated)</li><li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li><li>1 yellow onion (diced small)</li><li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li><li>2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li><li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li><li>2 cans (6 ounces each) solid light tuna packed in water (drained and flaked)</li><li>1 cup frozen peas (thawed)</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta 2 minutes less than package instructions (it will be undercooked). Drain. In a small bowl, toss together panko, Parmesan, and 2 teaspoons oil.

2. In pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Add onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook until softened, 8 minutes. Add flour and whisk to coat onion with flour. Slowly whisk in broth, then milk.

3. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until sauce is thickened, about 8 minutes. Stir in pasta, tuna, and peas and season to taste with salt and pepper.

4. Transfer tuna mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and top with panko mixture. Bake until sauce is bubbling and crust is golden, 17 to 20 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.
