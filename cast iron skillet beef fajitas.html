Score both sides of the flank steak with a sharp knife in a diamond pattern 1/4 inch deep. Combine the Orange juice, lime juice, garlic, chile, cilantro, cumin, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste in a heavy resealable plastic bag. Mix well, then add the oil and mix well again. Add the steak and marinate it in the refrigerator for a minimum of 6 hours, or preferably overnight. 

2. Heat a 12-inch skillet over high heat. Drain the steak from the marinade, discarding the marinade, and pat the steak dry with paper towels. Cook the steak for 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare, or to desired oneness. Transfer the steak to a cutting board, tent it loosely with foil, and let it rest for at least 5 minutes. 

3. Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-high, then add the oil and tilt the pan around to coat it evenly. Add the onion, bell peppers, chiles, and garlic, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Add the tomatoes, lime juice, cumin, and cilantro, and cook for 2 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

4. Cut the steak into thin slices against the grain on a diagonal. Wrap the tortillas in plastic wrap, and microwave on high (100 percent power) for 20 to 30 seconds, or until warm and pliable. To serve, places slices of meat and a portion of the vegetable mixture in each tortilla, rolling it gently. Serve immediately, passing bowls of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole separately.

Note: The vegetable mixture can be made 4 hours in advance and kept at room temperature in the skillet. Cook the beef just before serving. 

Variation: Substitute boneless, skinless chicken for the beef. Marinate the chicken for 3 hours, and cook the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes, or until cooked through and no longer pink.</pre>
