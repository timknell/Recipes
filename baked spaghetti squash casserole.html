To make the spaghetti squash, preheat oven to 350 degrees F and cut squash right down the middle. Scoop out all the seeds and place cut side down on a baking sheet lightly sprayed with oil so they don't stick.

2. Bake squash in the oven for 45 minutes until tender.

3. Meanwhile, drizzle oil into a large pan over medium heat and saute onion and garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add ground beef and cook until meat is no longer pink; drain if necessary.

4. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken broth, Italian seasoning, Stevia, salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and allow sauce to simmer until the spaghetti squash has finished baking.

5. When your squash is about ready, stir in grated Parmesan cheese and 2 tablespoons fresh basil in with the sauce; continue to simmer.

6. Remove squash from the oven and scrape out all the strands of spaghetti using a fork, placing into a large bowl for convenience.

7. In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spoon 1½ cups of meat sauce into bottom and spread out evenly. Layer with ½ of the spaghetti squash then 1½ cups more of meat sauce, then the rest of the spaghetti squash, the rest of the meat sauce (1½ cups) and top with mozzarella cheese.

8. Cover with foil and bake spaghetti squash casserole in the oven at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes, then remove foil and bake and additional 10 minutes until cheese is melted.

9. Top with remaining tablespoon of basil, serve and enjoy!
