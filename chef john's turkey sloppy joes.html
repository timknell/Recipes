It tastes enough like a traditional beef Sloppy Joe to provide that satisfying comfort food fix, yet seems much lighter.&quot;</pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>2 tablespoons butter</li><li>1 onions (diced)</li><li>1 1/4 pounds ground turkey</li><li>1/2 cup cold water</li><li>3/4 cup ketchup</li><li>1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar</li><li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or to taste)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li><li>1/2 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li><li>1 cup water (or as needed)</li><li>6 hamburger buns (split)</li><li>1/3 cup chopped green onions</li><li>1/2 cup shredded white Cheddar cheese</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1. Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black.

2. Mix ground turkey and 1/2 cup cold water into onions. Cook and stir, breaking up the meat, until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Add ketchup, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Stir in Worcestershire sauce and cocoa powder. Cook, stirring frequently and adding up to 1 cup water if needed, until meat is cooked through and liquid is reduced and thick, 20 to 30 minutes.

3. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Toast hamburger buns until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.

4. Remove turkey mixture from the heat and mix in green onions and Cheddar cheese. Serve on toasted hamburger buns.
