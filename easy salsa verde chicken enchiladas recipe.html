Make Sauce

2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat then cook garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the salsa verde and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from the heat then stir in the sour cream and cilantro. Taste for seasoning, adjusting with salt, pepper or more sour cream if the sauce it too spicy.

3. Set aside about 1 cup of the sauce for assembling the enchiladas.

4. Make Chicken Filling

5. Stir the shredded chicken and half of the cheese into the sauce that has not been set aside.

6. To Finish

7. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 2-quart baking dish and spread a little reserved sauce on the bottom.

8. Add about 1/3 cup of the chicken filling to the middle of each tortilla and roll into a cylinder. Repeat, lining up tortillas, seam-side down, tightly in the dish.

9. Spread the reserved sauce over the tortillas and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and place in the oven. Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes. Remove the foil and bake 10 minutes longer, until the cheese is melted. Serve with cilantro on top.

10. Adam and Joanne's Tips

11. Meatless Version: Swap the chicken for vegetables such as zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, onion, and winter squash. Add them to the creamy sauce cooked, but still with some crunch since they will continue to cook in the oven.
