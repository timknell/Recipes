Eggs added to a pot of boiling water rather than brought to a boil along with the cold water will be easier to peel. Plus, this method allows for more precise timing. And when you’re boiling eggs with the intention of jamminess—say, for soy-marinated eggs—timing is crucial. But don’t actually drop them in, or you’ll risk lopsided or deflated eggs. Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently lower the eggs into the hot water. Then lower the high heat to maintain a gentle simmer rather than a rolling boil, so the eggs don’t knock around in the pot.

You don’t need to add baking soda or vinegar or salt at this point. Any methods you’ve seen touting these remedies for easy-peel eggs are just folklore. The only thing you need to remember is to add enough water so that the eggs are fully submerged. If any are peeking above the line, they won’t cook evenly.

Set a 7-minute cook time for jammy eggs with set egg whites and firm but gooey yolks, or a 10-minute total time for eggs that are cooked through (but not chalky). You'll need a bit more time if you’re using jumbo or extra-large eggs.

Use an ice bath
