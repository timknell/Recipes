3. Heat oven to 500 degrees. Using a mixer, beat cream cheese at medium-low speed to break up and soften slightly, about 1 minute.

4. Add salt and about half of sugar and beat at medium-low speed for about 1 minute. Add the remaining sugar until combined, for another 1 minute.

5. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla, and beat at low speed for another minute. Add egg yolks and beat at medium-low speed until thoroughly combined.

6. Scrape bowl and add whole eggs two at a time, beating until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute, and scraping bowl between additions.

7. Brush sides of springform pan with remaining 1/2 tablespoon melted butter. Pour filling into cooled crust and bake 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees and continue to bake for about 1 1/2 hours.

8. Remove cake from the oven and cool for 3 hours. Cover and refrigerate until cold for at least  3 hours.
