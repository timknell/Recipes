Nutrition has taught me that we really are what we eat. I love gardening, and have a small flock of laying hens. Cooking for my family and friends with simple ingredients is a passion of mine. I feel blessed to live in Western Massachusetts – where much of what we choose to eat is locally grown. For me, cooking and baking at home is 'the good life'.</pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li><li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li><li>2/3 cup sugar</li><li>6 tsp baking powder</li><li>1 tsp salt</li><li>2 cups blueberries</li><li>2 large eggs</li><li>2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li><li>2 cups milk</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1.
