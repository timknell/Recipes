In a large bowl, whisk together eggs milk, salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Set aside.

2. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to a large nonstick skillet over medium and heat until it shimmers. Add the spinach and cook stirring often, until it begins to wilt, about 1 minute. Add the beans, then carefully pour in the eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, just until set, about 3 minutes. Taste and season with additional salt or pepper as desired. Remove from the heat.

4. To cook, carefully wipe out the skillet, lightly coat with olive oil, then heat over medium. Cook the assembled quesadillas on both sides until golden and the cheese is melted, about 5-6 minutes total. Cut into triangles and serve warm.
