Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and coat the inside of a 9-inch pie plate, cast iron skillet, or 8x8 casserole dish with non-stick spray (or butter for more flavor).

2. In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until evenly combined.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil.

4. Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until everything is moist. Avoid over stirring. It's okay if there are a few lumps.

5. Pour the batter into the prepared dish and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the top and edges are golden brown. Cut into 8 pieces and serve.

6. Alternate muffin recipe: makes 12, cook 10-13 minutes.
