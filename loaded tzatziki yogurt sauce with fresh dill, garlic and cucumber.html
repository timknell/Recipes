More →</pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>1 cucumber (peeled)</li><li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li><li>1 cup fresh dill (stems removed)</li><li>2 cups Greek yogurt</li><li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li><li>6 cloves garlic, pressed through a garlic press or finely minced</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1. Grate cucumber into a colander resting over a bowl. Sprinkle salt on grated cucumber. Let this sit for about 15 minutes as you prepare rest of tzatziki (water will come out of the cucumber).

2. Chop dill and then add it to a bowl with the Greek yogurt, olive oil and pressed garlic. Mix well.

3. Squeeze juice out of the cucumber and then add to tzatziki. Salt, to taste. You can serve immediately, but flavors meld over time. I like to refrigerate mine for at least an hour.</pre>
