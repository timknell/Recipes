Boil pasta according to package directions, ensure your veggies are cooked if necessary, and put container of cream out on counter so it is not super cold when you’re ready to use it.

2. Cut chicken into strips and season with salt and pepper.

3. Spread flour on a plate and put olive oil into sauté pan over medium-high heat.

4. While the oil is heating up, dredge the chicken pieces in the flour until well coated.

5. Sauté the coated chicken until brown and cooked all the way through (about 5 – 10 minutes depending on how thick your chicken pieces are).

6. Transfer the chicken to a plate and keep warm.

7. Turn heat off (very important if you have a gas stove and don’t want the wine to catch on fire!) and carefully add Marsala wine to pan. (Or substitute with the white grape juice, sherry vinegar, and vanilla.)

8. Turn heat back onto high and boil down the wine for a few minutes. Scrape the bits off the bottom of the pan while it’s cooking.

9. Keep the heat on high, add cream to pan, and stir sauce until it is bound together and starts to thicken (about 5 – 8 minutes).

10. Put the chicken pieces back in the sauce to heat them up again and coat them with sauce.

11. Evenly divide pasta among bowls and top with chicken, extra sauce, and veggies. Serve warm and enjoy!
