In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.

2. Make a well (hole) in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the honey, eggs, milk, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Whisk together thoroughly, but do not overmix.

3. Gently fold the mashed bananas into the batter with a spatula.

4. Heat a griddle or sauté pan over medium-high heat. Swirl enough butter around the pan until it is well coated. Add pancake batter using a soup ladle.

5. When the pancakes have begun to turn golden brown on the bottom, flip them over to cook the other side.

6. Serve with warm maple syrup and a side of fruit (like an apple, fresh blueberries, or a sliced banana if you just can't get enough). And don't forget to freeze the leftovers for another day!
