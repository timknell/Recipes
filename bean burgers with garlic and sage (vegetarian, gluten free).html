In a bowl, mash beans with a fork. Mash well, but don’t puree. I usually stop mashing when beans can be easily formed into a ball without falling apart.

2. Add all other ingredients (except olive oil). Blend well with a fork.

3. Heat oil on medium heat. Form bean mixture into patties. Fry until golden brown on one side and then flip and fry the same on the other side. Drain on paper towels.</pre>
