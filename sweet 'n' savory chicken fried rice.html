PREP
Wash and dry all produce. Drain pineapple. Halve lime; cut one half into wedges. Halve, peel, and dice onion. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch cubes.

2. COOK CHICKEN
Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and hoisin sauce and cook, tossing, until browned and cooked through, 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from pan and set aside. Wipe or rinse out any charred bits in pan.

3. COOK VEGGIES AND PINEAPPLE
Add onion and a large drizzle of oil to same pan over medium-high heat. Cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add pineapple and carrots and toss until pineapple is browned and carrots are tender, 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

4. FRY RICE
Massage Uncle Ben's Ready Rice Jasmine in packets to break up grains, then add to pan along with chicken and peas. Toss to thoroughly combine, breaking up any clumps of rice. Stir until rice is warmed through and tender, 1-2 minutes. 

5. SCRAMBLE EGGS
Push contents of pan to the sides, making a 3-inch well in the center (you should see the bottom of the pan). Crack eggs into well and beat vigorously to scramble, then toss into the other ingredients. 

6. FINISH AND SERVE
Remove pan from heat. Stir in soy sauce, sesame oil, and a squeeze of lime. Divide everything between bowls. Tear cilantro leaves from stems and scatter over top, then sprinkle with cashews. Drizzle sriracha over the adults' bowls (and the kids', too, if they like it spicy). Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over.</pre>
