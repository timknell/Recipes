Add 1 teaspoon oil and ground beef to the pan. Spread the meat around the pan and begin to break it up while it cooks.

2) Combine brown sugar and steak seasoning. Add this mixture to the meat while it cooks. When the meat has browned, remove from pan to drain oil.

3) Wipe pan out. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil to pan. Then, reduce heat to medium and add carrot, onion, red peppers, garlic, red wine vinegar, and Worcestershire to the skillet. Cook until veggies are tender, about 4-5 minutes.

4) Add cooked meat, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and maple syrup to pan. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to simmer and cook Sloppy Joe mixture 5 minutes longer. Season with salt to taste, if needed.

5) Using a large spoon or ice cream scoop, pile meat mixture onto toasted bun bottoms. Add a slice of cheese, if desired, and top with bun.

Fully cook and cool the Sloppy Joes (do not leave out of refrigerator or freezer more than 2 hours). Place in a freezer bag or freezer-safe container. Try to remove as much air as possible and seal and/or wrap it well before placing in the freezer.

To reheat, thaw for 24-48 hours in the refrigerator (preferred method) or in the microwave using the defrost setting. Then, warm over low to medium-low heat on the stove, gently stirring.
