I'm Vaishali, a journalist turned food blogger. At Holy Cow Vegan I share easy, tasty recipes made with clean, wholesome ingredients that the entire family can enjoy.</pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>1 medium onion</li><li>3 medium tomatoes</li><li>1 inch knob ginger</li><li>4 cloves garlic</li><li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li><li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li><li>2 teaspoons paprika</li><li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon cayenne</li><li>2 tablespoons raw cashews</li><li>1 teaspoon sugar</li><li>1 tablespoon fenugreek</li><li>1 tablespoon avocado oil or any neutral oil</li><li>14 oz extra firm tofu</li><li>2 tablespoon vegan butter</li><li>2 tablespoon cilantro</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1. Place all the ingredients, except the vegetable oil, tofu, butter, cilantro and salt, into a blender and blitz into a very smooth paste.

2. Heat the oil in a wide saucepan or wok. Add the tomato-onion paste and cook it, covered, over a medium-high flame, stirring frequently, until the moisture is mostly gone, the paste looks darker, and shimmers with oil droplets. The paste should look quite sticky at this point and should not taste raw. This step should take you anywhere from 10-15 minutes.

3. Add 2-3 cups of water or vegetable stock, depending on the thickness you want for your curry, along with the tofu cubes. Add salt, stir to mix everything, bring back to a boil and cover and cook another five minutes. Stir in the vegan butter.

4. Serve hot or warm, garnished with cilantro.</pre>
