Chili, corn chips and cheese are topped with lettuce and tomato. Spice it up with your favorite salsa. Vegetarian chili can be found with the regular chili - it is often labeled as 'fat free'. This recipe can easily be doubled, and cooked in a 9x13 inch baking dish."" - Author</pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>6 cups corn tortilla chips</li><li>2 cups vegetarian chili with beans</li><li>1 cup Cheddar cheese (shredded)</li><li>2 cups lettuce (shredded)</li><li>2 roma tomatoes (chopped)</li><li>1/2 cup salsa</li><li>1/4 cup sour cream</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1.
