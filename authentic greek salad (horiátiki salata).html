His family is from the island of Crete, and he lived with them for a whole summer. During that time, he started working for Mediterranean Living and contributing his firsthand experiences of the traditional Cretan diet. He learned fluent Greek along the way, being fully immersed in a traditional Cretan village. He is since graduated with a business degree from Worcester State University. George loves language and traveling, so he completed a TEFL certificate program at the Boston Language Institute in order to teach English abroad and travel the world. He currently works full-time blogging, recipe formulating, and social media marketing for Mediterranean Living. His passions include language, gardening, hiking, skateboarding, and watching sports. He dreams of living in Crete one day, after he travels the world learning as many languages and cultures as possible.</pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>3 medium tomatoes (quartered)</li><li>1 cucumber (peeled and sliced)</li><li>1/4 red onion (cut into strips)</li><li>1/4 red bell pepper (cut into thin strips)</li><li>10 kalamata olives</li><li>6 ounces feta cheese</li><li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li><li>1 splash red wine vinegar or lemon juice</li><li>1/2 tsp oregano</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1.
