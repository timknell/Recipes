It is simple, delicious, and quick to make, enjoy (I know you will).&quot;</pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>2 tablespoons butter</li><li>1 vidalia onion (chopped)</li><li>1 stalk celery (chopped)</li><li>3 cups chicken broth</li><li>8 cups broccoli florets</li><li>3 tablespoons butter</li><li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li><li>2 cups milk</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium sized stock pot, and saute onion and celery until tender. Add broccoli and broth, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.

2. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot or mash with potato masher. 

3. In small saucepan, over medium-heat melt 3 tablespoons butter, stir in flour and add milk. Stir until thick and bubbly, and add to soup. Season with pepper and serve.
