Blackberries (or raspberries, if you prefer) combined with whole-grain mustard make for a sweet-and-savory dipping sauce. Serve with: Steamed broccoli and carrots.</pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>1 cup fresh blackberries or raspberries (finely chopped)</li><li>1 1/2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard</li><li>2 teaspoons honey</li><li>1 pound chicken tenders (cut in half crosswise (see Tip))</li><li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li><li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li><li>3 tablespoons cornmeal</li><li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1. Mash blackberries (or raspberries), mustard and honey in a small bowl until it looks like a chunky sauce.

2. Sprinkle chicken tenders with salt and pepper. Place cornmeal in a medium bowl, add the chicken and toss to coat (discard any leftover cornmeal).

3. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook the chicken, turning once or twice, until browned and just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes total (thinner nuggets will cook faster than thicker ones). Serve the chicken nuggets with the berry mustard.</pre>
