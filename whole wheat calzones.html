Stir and let sit until the yeast starts to foam and bubble, about 10 minutes.

2) Using the dough hook, turn the mixer on low and slowly olive oil, honey, salt and the flour in 1 cup increments until all is added. Once dough starts to form, increase speed to medium. Mix for 5 minutes, until dough is well combined.

3) Dust the counter with flour. Remove the dough and knead on counter a few times to form a ball. Place dough in a well-greased bowl, cover loosely with a towel, and let rise for 30 minutes in a warm place. At this point, dough is ready to use for calzones or to freeze to use later.

1) Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

2) In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella, eggs, parsley, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper. If using pre-cooked Italian sausage or pepperoni, stir in now. Set aside.

3) Grab a pinch of dough and roll into about a 2 inch ball (or desired size of calzone.) Roll out very thin, about &frac14; of an inch thick.

4) Spoon 3-4 tablespoons (approximately) filling onto half of the dough circle, leaving a little room around the edges. (Do not overfill the calzone or it will split open while baking.) Fold half of the dough over itself, then press edges to seal. Use the back of a fork to make sure it's sealed well. Then, poke a few holes with the fork in the top of each calzone.

5) Brush surface of calzone with beaten egg, then bake on a parchment or foiled-lined baking sheet for 10-13 minutes, or until nice and golden brown. Serve with warm marinara sauce.

Cook according to instructions. Let calzones cool. Place in an airtight freezer bag or container. Freeze until ready to eat.

Wrap frozen calzone in moist paper towel. Microwave on defrost setting until warmed through.
