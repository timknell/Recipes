When the butter is all spread out, place the piece of bread in the skillet and crack the egg straight into the center of hole.<br><br>Cook for at least 30 seconds or so before attempting to move the bread or things could get messy. Sprinkle the egg with salt and pepper to taste. After about a minute, flip it over with a spatula and salt and pepper the other side.<br><br>Now move the whole piece of toast around the skillet, soaking up all of the glorious butter. Let it cook until the yolk feels, to the touch, still soft without feeling over-jiggly. Here’s the key: golden brown toast, white  (not brown/burned) whites, soft unbroken yolk.<br><br>Here’s the other secret: just one of these suckers is all I need to feel whole, happy and free.</pre>
