Make the red wine vinaigrette. Whisk all the ingredients together in a medium bowl. Alternatively, place all the ingredients in a jar, seal, and shake to combine.

2. Prepare the greens. Wash the romaine and watercress, then dry very well. Toss together in a large serving bowl.

3. Top with the remaining ingredients. Top the greens with the chicken, cucumber, avocado, tomatoes, blue cheese, bacon, and shallot. You can arrange them in a pattern or pile them on top, but keep in mind that the salad will be tossed before serving.

4. Toss the salad and add the dressing. Before dressing the salad, use tongs to toss everything together first. Drizzle in about half of the red wine vinaigrette and toss. Taste and add more dressing as needed.

5. Recipe Notes

6. Make ahead: The red wine vinaigrette can be made several days in advance and refrigerated; rewhisk or shake again before using. The undressed salad can be assembled and refrigerated without the avocado up to 24 hours in advance. Add the avocado before tossing with the dressing.
