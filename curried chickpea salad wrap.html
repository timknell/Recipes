Add remaining chickpeas to the bowl and stir to combine.

Small dice celery and add to the bowl.

Trim off and discard ends of the green onions; cut crosswise into Â¼-inch pieces and transfer to the bowl.

Using a knife, shave dill leaves off the stems; discard stems and mince the leaves. Add to the bowl and stir to combine the chickpea salad.

Warm flatbreads in a skillet, oven, or toaster (optional).

Meanwhile, slice tomatoes into rounds.

Divide lettuce and tomato slices between flatbreads and season with salt and pepper. Top with curried chickpea salad.

To make wraps easier to eat, place flatbreads on individual squares of parchment paper. Use the paper to tightly roll and secure each wrap. Otherwise eat as is and get a little messy! Enjoy!</pre>
