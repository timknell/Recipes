It's so scrumptious that you'll be glad the recipe makes not one but two 13-inch pizzas! —Loretta Lawrence, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina</pre><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>3 teaspoons active dry yeast</li><li>1 cup warm water (110° to 115°)</li><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li><li>1 teaspoon sugar</li><li>1 teaspoon salt</li><li>3 cups bread flour</li><li>2 14-ounce cans diced tomatoes (drained)</li><li>20 fresh basil leaves (thinly sliced)</li><li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li><li>8 cups mozzarella cheese (shredded part-skim)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (crushed)</li><li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li><li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li></ul><h2>Preparation</h2><pre>1. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine the oil, sugar, salt and 1 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.

2. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

3. Punch dough down; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 13-in. circle. Transfer to two greased 14-in. pizza pans; build up edges slightly. Cover with a clean kitchen towel; let rest for 10 minutes.

4. Spoon tomatoes over dough. Top with basil, oregano, cheese, pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil. Bake at 450° for 15-20 minutes or until crust is golden brown.</pre>
