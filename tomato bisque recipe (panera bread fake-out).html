In a large stockpot or dutch oven, heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil over medium high heat. Add the chopped onion, carrot, celery, garlic, and bay leaves. Then, season with salt, pepper, and red pepper. Stir occasionally until the vegetables are just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.

2. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir for 1 minute, or until flour is fully incorporated. Add the chicken stock, tomatoes, tomato paste and sugar. Season lightly with more with salt and pepper, if you'd like. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer (over about medium heat) and cover partially. Stir occasionally until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.

3. Remove the bay leaves. Transfer the soup in batches to a blender (or use an immersion blender) and puree until fairly smooth. (Note: Please be careful during this step! Don't fill the blender full, and cover the lid with a towel and hold securely while blending so the lid doesn't pop off.) Carefully, return the puree to the saucepan.

4. Add the half and half and cook over medium-low until the soup is just heated through. Taste and then season the soup with salt, pepper, and hot sauce to your preference. Swirl in the 4 tablespoons of butter. Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with croutons, fresh shredded Parmesan cheese, and serve.
