2) Spray a 9x13 casserole dish with cooking spray. Add stew meat, potatoes, carrots, and onions. Season with a little pepper and toss together.

3) Dump the can of green beans, liquid and all, over the top of meat and vegetables.

4) Lastly, pour the tomato soup (or marinara) and cream of mushroom soup over the top. Gently combine with a spoon if you want but not necessary.

5) Tightly cover with foil. Place casserole dish on a cookie sheet with sides, in case of overflow. Bake at 275 degrees for 5 hours. Don't peek!

Complete steps 2-4 in the slow cooker. Place the lid on and set to LOW for 8 hours. (Do not peek!)

Fully cook and cool stew (do not leave out of refrigerator or freezer more than 2 hours!). Place in a freezer bag or freezer-safe container. Try to remove as much air as possible and seal and/or wrap it well before placing in the freezer.

To reheat, thaw for 24-48 hours in the refrigerator (preferred method) or in the microwave using the defrost setting. Then, warm over low to medium-low heat on the stove, gently stirring occasionally.
